### just said don't have enough manpower

### what the &@#)[! ?

### ... bare with me for a moment though

## mchview program

- based on Root GUI
- looks old (code _is_ old)
- dev painfull
- quite slow
- tied to AliRoot

+++

## Modernizing it

- using current web technologies <i class="fa fa-html5" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-css3" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="devicons devicons-javascript" aria-hidden="true"></i>

- like the online systems will do

+++

## Modern dev techniques

## mean

## more opportunities to hire skilled people

## (outside of our community)

+++

## Ideas, requirements, complaints ?

### for mchview
### for new helpers
### ?

## Please contact me

# Simulation

## Some rough ideas

+++

# Porting 

## (Ali<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Fair)Root

- less advanced coding skills required
- @O(1) at least... if we move 1-to-1 features

+++

# Beyond mere porting

+++

# Geometry improvement

- some parts have to be refined
- e.g. new PCBs for St12
- e.g. flex cables running on St345

+++

# Hit creation improvement

- rework the detector response 
- to get closer to real resolution

+++

# Opportunity for students ?
