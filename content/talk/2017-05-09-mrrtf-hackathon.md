# Planning

My input to WP12 and WP13 documents should be continued :

- tasks entered into JIRA for follow-up

# Agile

+++

## @last offline week Giulio tossed the idea of using Agile methods for O2

+++

## Scrum (one Agile method)

- might be (at least partly) applicable to us

+++

## Would you be interested in a presentation about Scrum ?

+++

## So we can answer the question ...

+++

## Can Snails Sprint ?
