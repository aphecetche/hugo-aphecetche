## Applicable to code ~now

- [New build procedure for the ALICE software](https://indico.cern.ch/event/508147/session/5/contribution/7/attachments/1250734/1844016/2016-offline-week-alibuild.pdf)

  - will be effective for AliRoot as well as of next week
  - sorry but I'm afraid Oxy has to go...

- [Report from DDS workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/508147/session/7/contribution/4/attachments/1251239/1845303/DDS-workshop-2016_04.pdf)
  - Dynamic Deployment System
  - we don't have much to deploy yet, but that will come

- [New API for serialisation in ALFA](https://indico.cern.ch/event/508147/session/7/contribution/3/attachments/1251143/1844839/winckler-ALICE-Offline-Week-2016.pdf)
  - while we should keep a close eye on serialization and deserialization performances, using it now can ease gluing things together (HLT components, offline components)

  - progress made but implementations not completed yet

## DPG

- That's a Run2 thing, why bother here ?

- Because :

  - part of the DPG mandate is the (evolution of)
AOD format(s). That is relevant to Run3 as well.

  - Members of this team will most likely be involved...
